Searching in the app shows results based on tags that may be present for a file in the firebase database.
When an option is selected the url/filepath will be read from the firebase database and sent to the loadContent() funciton.
loadContent loads the file contents to the app.

Database:
File_1 -> url1 -> tags: geraldton, policy, essential...
File_2 -> url2 -> tags: geraldton, emergency, evacuation...
...
File_17 -> url17 -> tags: pilbara, accomodation, booking

E.g. if we search for geraldton we will have the following options:

File_1
File_2
...

Selecting File_1 reads url1 and sends it to loadContent()

Content is loaded

On the home screen / location screen we may have to hardcode certain options to choose
