WACRH Student Information App
We are a part of UWA that supports mainly Allied Health students on their rural placement. During this time they stay in our accommodation and we usually have a paper based file in the units that the students may or may not read. We would love to produce an App that has all of this information in it.
The information in the app could include WACRH policies, site specific info, town info, vacating procedures, placement info, covid info, In case of emergency info. So it is very much info based but it would ensure that the students have the information that they need in a relevant, easy to access format that we would be able to update easily.

We have accommodation in Geraldton (2 separate accommodation), Mullewa, Mt Magnet (Student and Staff Housing), Newman, Carnarvon, Port Hedland and Karratha (4 separate accommodation) so it is alot of logistics to update the information that we like the students to have access to. There are other ways of tackling this but an App is something that we might be able to build on. Another possible feature is a shared help forum which can allow anonymous posts, but would need user login. There will also need to be arrangements around data security.

Whilst we are, as a main office, situated remotely in Geraldton, we are a part of the School of Allied Health and do have staff situated in Perth (though they are working from home for the most part at the moment) I do really hope that you are able to assist us in this, as its an exciting way to move forward in the administration aspect of our student programs.
